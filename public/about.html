<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Designing Beyond Aesthetics — The Craft of Guna Sandy</h2>
<p>With over 8 years of experience in the design industry, I’ve learned that great design is more than how it looks—it’s how it works, how it feels, and how it communicates without needing to shout. My journey began with curiosity and grew into a deep-rooted passion for creating visuals that are both functional and impactful. From branding identities to user interfaces, I focus on clarity, balance, and intent in every pixel.</p>

<p>As a Graphic cum UI Designer, I bring together the worlds of art and interaction. I thrive on transforming ideas into meaningful visual systems that serve real users and real businesses. Whether it's designing a brand from scratch or crafting seamless UI flows for web and mobile, I approach every project with a user-first mindset and a minimalist design philosophy that values simplicity without sacrificing depth.</p>

<p>What sets my work apart is the harmony between strategy and creativity. I listen deeply, think critically, and design thoughtfully—always aiming to deliver results that not only look beautiful but work beautifully too. My goal is simple: to create designs that solve, inspire, and connect.</p>
